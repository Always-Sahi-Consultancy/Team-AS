      <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
      <p>
        After access is granted, due to the sensitive, proprietary nature of the
        copyrighted content, Always Sahi Academy will not refund the fees for
        any reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        While Always Sahi (Always Sahi Academy) has gone to great lengths to
        build exhaustive resources containing all of the necessary lessons,
        tools, and practice materials to ensure students will have success after
        taking the course, Always Sahi Academy cannot guarantee that all
        students will successfully start making money for themselves after
        taking the courses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just as colleges and universities do not guarantee you will get a job
        after graduating, students enrolled in Always Sahi Academy are not
        guaranteed success or income merely by completing the course. All
        students who enroll acknowledge this fact and agree that securing
        clients is solely their own responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        Further, before enrolling in the course, students agree that any
        success/income is solely dependent upon their own understanding and
        application of the material, content, and methods as outlined in the
        course. Not following instructions, lacking personal aptitude or any
        prerequisite skills (i.e. not retaining or understanding necessary
        concepts, etc.), The course provides the necessary tools to help you
        create a side-hustle, but it cannot do the work for you. Finally,
        students acknowledge that Always Sahi Academy will not find clients for
        them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember, taking the course does not invariably make you an expert — you
        either work towards it, or you do not. Access to our private Facebook
        group is also an excellent support tool for students.
      </p>
      <p>
        Always Sahi is a course in which you enroll, not a product you purchase,
        use, and then return if they don’t fit. As is the case with digital
        products, after access is granted, due to the sensitive, proprietary
        nature of the copyrighted content, Always Sahi Academy will not refund
        the fees for any reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similar to a college or university class environment, you cannot request
        a refund from Always Sahi Academy once you’ve purchased the course. If
        you are not ready to take action, don’t commit.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you implement the course, you will get results. If you don’t, you
        won’t get results. If you feel stuck with the course material or feel
        like a part of the class isn’t making sense, email us and we will walk
        you through a solution.
