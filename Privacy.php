        <h2>PERSONAL AND NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
        <p>Our Privacy Policy identifies how we treat your personal and non-personal information.</p>
        <h2>WHAT IS NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION AND HOW IS IT COLLECTED AND USED?  </h2>
        <p>Nonpersonal information is information that cannot identify you. If you visit this website to read information, such as information about one of our services, we may collect certain non-personal information about you from your computer’s web browser. Because non-personal information cannot identify you or be tied to you in any way, there are no restrictions on the ways that we can use or share non-personal information.
</p>
<h2>What is personal information and how is it collected?
</h2>
<p>Personal information identifies you as an individual, such as your name, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone number. We may collect personal information from you in a variety of ways:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>When you send us an application or other form</li>
    <li>When you conduct a transaction with us, our affiliates, or others
</li>
<li>When we collect information about you in support of a transaction, such as credit card information
</li>
<li>In some places on this website, you have the opportunity to send us personal information about yourself, to elect to receive particular information, to purchase access to one of our products or services, or to participate in an activity.</li>
<h2>ARE COOKIES OR OTHER TECHNOLOGIES USED TO COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>
<p>Yes, we may use cookies and related technologies, such as web beacons, to collect information on our website. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you register with us, a cookie helps Always Sahi Academy to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Always Sahi Academy website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the features that you customized. A web beacon is a small graphic image that allows the party that set the web beacon to monitor and collect certain information about the viewer of the web page, web-based document, or e-mail message, such as the type of browser requesting the web beacon, the IP address of the computer that the web beacon is sent to and the time the web beacon was viewed. Web beacons can be very small and invisible to the user, but, in general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page or e-mail, including HTML-based content, can act as a web beacon. We may use web beacons to count visitors to the web pages on the website or to monitor how our users navigate the website, and we may include web beacons in e-mail messages in order to count how many messages sent were actually opened, acted upon, or forwarded.</p>
<p>Third-party vendors also may use cookies on our website. For instance, we may contract with third parties who will use cookies on our website to track and analyze anonymous usage and volume statistical information from our visitors and members. Such information is shared externally only on an anonymous, aggregated basis. These third parties use persistent cookies to help us to improve the visitor experience, manage our site content, and to track visitor behavior. We may also contract with a third party to send e-mail to our registered users/members.
</p>
<p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of Always Sahi Academy websites you visit.</p>
